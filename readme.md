#Omaha Film Festival - Wordpress Theme#

##Description#

This is a Wordpress theme created for the [Omaha Film Festival](http://www.omahafilmfestival.org) to replace their static site.

There are five notable regions to the theme, not counting the main content.

1. **Top Navigation Bar**: We use this for organization-wide information and archives.
2. **Side Navigation Bar**: We use this for things specific to this year's festival.
3. **Events Bar**: This is linked to a google calendar, and displays upcoming events
4. **Top Banner**: Top banner image. Uploadable under the "Appearance > Header" options in the Wordpress dashboard
5. **Footer Image**: Uploadable using the Footer pseudo-sidebar under "Appearance > Widgets"

##Installation#

We've already set up your wordpress site, but in case you ever need to reinstall the theme, you can follow these steps:

1.  Download the zipped theme file from Github
2.  Using an FTP client, upload the contents of the zip file into the `wp-content/themes` folder of your project; if it hasn't already happened, these files should be in a folder called `OmahaFilmFestival` (or similar; the important thing here is the lack of spaces).
3.  Under the *Appearances* tab in the Wordpress dashboard, select the Omaha Film Festival theme and activate it.
4.  Under the *Plugins* tab, find and install two widgets, one called "Google Calendar Events" and the other called "Simple Image Widget"; you won't need them just yet, but it's useful to get them installed and set up quickly.
