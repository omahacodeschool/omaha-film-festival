#Omaha Film Festival#

Paul and Andrew update the [Omaha Film Festival](http://www.omahafilmfestival.org/) website to be in Wordpress.

##Home Page#
Welcome message & Description, announcements, Events (sidebar), Navigation (Top and Side), sponsors footer, header

Currently no meaningful difference exists between topbar and sidebar, but we are thinking that the topbar could be for organization-wide things / pages that are true every year, whereas the sidebar could be information for the current year's festival.

###Events Sidebar#
Upcoming and past events + header)

###TopNav#
Home, Films, Tickets, Call for Entries, Sponsors, Media, Archive, Contact

###SideNav#
Films, Screenplay finalists, conference, parties, buzz, festival passes

###Sponsor Footer#
A bunch of sponsor logos, each of which are linked to homepages of the relevant sponsors

##Films (link)#
Links to external schedule (last year's, in this case) -- Sched

##Tickets (link)#
Link to brownpapertickets.com

##Call for Entries :: page#
How to submit, plus link to (external) submission forms (filmfreeway, withoutabox)

Twitter sidebar instead of side nav, and the normal events sidebar

##Sponsors :: page#

Similar to the footer, but in the main box.

Twitter sidebar instead of side nav.

##Media :: link to posts by tag="media"#

Big list of content, mostly of media mentions, as well as some images and embedded youtube video

Twitter sidebar

##Archive :: link to posts by tag="awards"#

Big list of previous awards, organized by year. `<hr>` tags between each year. Goes back to 2006. 

Twitter sidebar instead of side nav

Twitter sidebar instead of side nav

##Films (SideNav) :: link#

Same as Films link on top nav

##Screenplay Finalists (SideNav) :: posts by tag="screenplay finalists"#

Very similar information to the most recent year of the archives, though with more description. Currently in chronological order (most recent at the end), which maybe could change.

Sidenav instead of twitter feed

##Schedule (SideNav) :: link#

Same as "Films" link in SideNav/TopNav

##Conference (SideNav) :: page / link#
Big list of events with times and places (this might be the actual schedule).

Includes "Writer's Theatre" and Conference Panel info, both of which open to external links (Sched)

Some party events have links to FB events, but not all.
